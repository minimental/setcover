WOMEN = {woman};
MEN = {man_1, man_2};

% If there's only one woman and two man.
% The woman does not care about neither of them.
% But one man favors her (man_1) while the other does not (man_2).
% Then the bit of favor makes the difference and the woman and man_1 make a (stable) match.

% But it turns out that this parameterization does not work.
% Is the model inconsistent, as claimed?
% Try to solve it yourself.
% What about the base constraint?
%
% Let mens_choice = [woman, woman]
%
% Here, the problem uncovers:
%
% We need the same number of men and women.
