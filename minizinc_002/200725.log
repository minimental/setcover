0 - unsatisfiable
Reason: if you choose s_0 = 0, this is wrong. Since index 0 is used once, not (not at all).
        if you choose s_0 = 1, this is wrong. Since index 0 is used not at all, not once.
		if you choose s_0 = 2, this is wrong. Since index 0 is used not at all, not once.

(0, 0) - wrong: index 0 is used twice, not (not at all)
(1, 0) - wrong: index 1 is used once, not (not at all)
(1, 1) - wrong: index 0 is used not at all, not once.
(0, 1) - wrong: index 0 is used once, not (not at all).
Every other combination needs digits greater than 1. But these are not included.

(0, 0, 0) - wrong
(2, 0, 0) - wrong: index 2 is used once, not (not at all)
(2, 0, 1) - wrong: index 0 is used once, not twice.
(1, 0, 1) - wrong: index 1 is used twice, not (not at all)
(1, 2, 1) - wrong: index 0 is used not at all, not once.
Is 2 possible at all?
It is not possible for 0, since (2, 0, 0) is the only possible permutation, and wrong.
Is it possible for 1? Then (1, 2, 1) which is wrong, since there is no 0 involved.
Is it possible for 2? No, since this exceeds the number of items
Is 1 possible at all?
0: (1, 0, 1) - wrong, index 1 is used twice.
0: (1, 1, 0) - wrong, index 1 is used twice.
And since 0 is not possible for index 0, since that would contradict the fact that it is used once, three indices are unsatisfiable.

(*, 0, 0, 0) - * must be 3. Which is wrong, since it is claimed that there is no `3' involved.
(1, 3, 1, 1) - wrong, since there is no 0 included.
(1, 2, 1, 0) - oops.. found a solution by accident.
