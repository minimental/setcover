% A bit more interesting than the first are two jobs where the first drills holes and trims them, where the second drills holes, makes threads, and then trims them.
% How would you intuitively schedule such two jobs in your production?
% You probably start with the job just drilling the holes
% After the holes are drilled you would start the longer job which includes making threads
% Which leaves you with an end time of the longer job + waiting time for drilling which accounts for 9 time units
%
% Oops.
%
% Both jobs start with drilling. x(
% Thought I took of non-overlapping tasks..?!
%
% Mixed up indices, alright.
% But why does it only take 8 time units..?!
%
% Wait, this is interesting:
%
% 1st job: iiddiiit
% 2nd job: ddttttti
%
% So my intuition was wrong: It is the more time costly job which starts, runs through, while the other waits, if required.
% Duh!
